# JuanTamad 

Just Another TimeIn/Out Automated Management Application Duh! or JuanTamad is a daily email time recording system app using Power Automate Desktop. Ok, this is not a standalone app, you need Microsoft Power Automate Desktop to use it. And, unlike a regular app, you cant just download and install, you need to recreate the flow... manually, inside PAD.

## Who is JuanTamad ?

JuanTamad is a fictitious person known to Filipinos representing the lazy portion of the population. In an old story, he used to lay with mouth wide open under a mango tree waiting for the fruit to fall due to gravity. This app, however, does not glorify lazyness :) It aims to make the boring task of emailing our whereabouts before and after our daily shift simpler and easier using Power Automate Desktop.
